## Figures

![Phase 1 Countries](https://github.com/pranavmishra90/COVID-19/blob/master/Figures/Phase_1_Countries.jpg) 

**Figure 1 - Phase 1 Expansion of COVID-19 with Models:** We aligned the data from each Phase 1 country, such that t=1 day when the number of cases is closest to, but greater than 100. We include 95% confidence intervals in red, which contain the trajectory of most countries. Disparity is expected near t=1, as countries expand beyond the 100-case cutoff at varying rates. Many reasons exist for early variation in case detection, including, but not limited to, differences in international seeding from China, testing capabilities, healthcare systems, public health policy, including quarantine measures.

![Phase 2 BRIAS Countries](https://github.com/pranavmishra90/COVID-19/blob/master/Figures/Phase_2_BRIAS_Countries.jpg) 

**Figure 2 - Projection of COVID-19 expansion on Phase 2 BRIAS countries:** This group of countries includes the large developing nations of Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa. We have additionally included Australia as a country of interest, which escaped the initial international expansion of COVID-19.

**Figure 3 - Coming soon, pending publication**

![Doubling Time Histogram](https://github.com/pranavmishra90/COVID-19/blob/master/Figures/Doubling_time_histogram_(latest).jpg) 

**Figure 4 - Distribution of doubling times:** As different countries implement different disease mitigation strategies, the rate of expansion within each country varies. A histogram is created of case doubling times, in days, for each country. Countries with a doubling time greater than 365 days are excluded due to likely erronous or incomplete data.
